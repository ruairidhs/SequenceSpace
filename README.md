# SequenceSpace

This module contains functions to implement the algorithms presented in [Using the Sequence-Space Jacobian to Solve and Estimate Heterogeneous-Agent Models](http://web.stanford.edu/~aauclert/sequence_space_jacobian.pdf), by Auclert, Bard√≥czy, Rognlie and Straub (2020).

## Running the code
The module and all core dependencies can be installed by entering the package manager in the Julia REPL with `]`, then `add <FILEPATH>` where `<FILEPATH>` is where this directory is saved on your computer.

**Important:**
This package relies on `ForwardDiff.jl` for derivatives.
It requires enabling ForwardDiff's NaN-safe mode by setting the `NANSAFE_MODE_ENABLED` constant to true in ForwardDiff's source. The constant is located in `src\prelude.jl` within ForwardDiff.
This issue is explained [here](http://www.juliadiff.org/ForwardDiff.jl/stable/user/advanced/#Fixing-NaN/Inf-Issues).

## Examples
The subdirectory `examples` contains well-commented code that replicates the Krusell-Smith and one-asset HANK models from the paper, illustrating how to use the package.

## src
The subdirectory `src` defines the functions and types required for computing the jacobians and likelihoods and can be loaded with `using SequenceSpace`.
